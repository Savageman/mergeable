# reviewer

Reviewer is an inbox for GitHub pull requests.
It is an attempt at being better than GitHub when providing an overview of open pull requests needing my attention.

It provides the following features:
* Fully customisable sections.
* Any number of GitHub instances can be connected (e.g., GitHub Enterprise).
* Number of pending pull requests is shown in the page's title.
* Local only, data is stored in your browser's storage.
* Dark mode.

You can use the demo instance hosted at [reviewer.pages.dev](https://reviewer.pages.dev/), or run your own instance.
